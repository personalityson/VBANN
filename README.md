### What is VBANN?
VBANN is a small machine learning framework implemented in VBA, which can be used to set up and train simple neural networks.<br/>
VBANN is designed to store everything in the same file. Your training data, your model and the framework itself are all contained in the same workbook.<br/>
You can speed it up 6-10x by downloading and linking to a prebuilt [OpenBLAS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openblas/files/) dll (see BlasFunctions module).

### Why do people use VBA?
VBA runs on locked-down mandatory corporate Windows laptops with no software installation privileges, firewalled networking and USB ports disabled.<br/>
Very often VBA is the only solution that can be implemented without approval from the IT department.
